        "CSV files typically take up less memory than JSON files for the same data because CSVs store data in a minimal, delimiter-separated format without repeating field names or additional structural characters. In a CSV, the first row usually defines the column names, and the subsequent rows simply list the values separated by commas, whereas JSON represents each record as an object with keys and values, which adds extra characters such as quotation marks, braces, and commas for every entry. However, a JSON file could be smaller than a CSV if it’s structured in a way that minimizes redundancy—such as using an array of arrays with a single header array for field names—or if the CSV requires many escape characters due to data containing commas, line breaks, or other special characters. Essentially, when the JSON structure is optimized to avoid unnecessary repetition and the CSV formatting introduces extra overhead, the JSON file can end up using less memory."

Take a moment and look at this JSON file in your web browser. The structure of this particular JSON is complicated, but see if you can find the team-by-team data.
